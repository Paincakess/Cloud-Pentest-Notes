**Amazon Athena** is a query service that allows you to analyze data in **Amazon S3** using SQL. It is a serverless service, meaning that you don't have to worry about setting up and maintaining infrastructure to run Athena. Instead, you can simply send your SQL queries to Athena and the service will execute them and return the results. 
**Amazon Athena** supports the ability to query S3 data that is already encrypted and if configured to do so, Athena can also encrypt the results of the query which can then be stored in S3.
