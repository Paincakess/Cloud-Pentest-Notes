 ECS provides a platform to host containerized applications in the cloud. ECS has two deployment methods, EC2 and Fargate.
 ECS operates using the following three building blocks: **Clusters**, **Services**, and **Task Definitions**.
 - **Clusters** are groups of containers that are running in the cloud.
 - **Services** are responsible for running tasks inside of clusters. Inside a service definition you define the number of tasks to run as well as general networking information such as VPCâ€™s, subnets, and security groups.
 - **Task Definitions** are responsible for defining what containers will run and the various parameters that will be configured with the containers. These parameters include any references to secrets or environment variables the containers need to operate.

## Cluster Information
- List Clusters
	- `aws ecs list-clusters`
- Get Details about the cluster
	- `aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters <cluster>`

## Container Information
- List Container Instances inside the cluster
	- `aws ecs list-container-instances`
- Get dtails about the containers
	- `aws ecs describe-container-instances`

## Service Enumeration
- List Services
	- `aws ecs list-services --cluster <cluster>`
- Get details about the service
	- `aws ecs describe-services --cluster <cluster> --services <services>`
- Get Tasks Sets
	- `aws ecs describe-task-sets --cluster <cluster> --service <service>`

## Task Enumeration
- List Tasks
	- `aws ecs list-task-definition-families`
	- `aws ecs list-task-definitions`
- Lists task inside the cluster
	- `aws ecs list-tasks --cluster <cluster>`
- Get task details
	- `aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster <cluster> --tasks <tasks>`
- Look for env vars and secrets used from the task definition
	- `aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <TASK_NAME>:<VERSION>`

# Vulnerabilities
## Sensitive Data In Task Definitions
Task definitions are responsible for configuring the actual containers that will be running in ECS. Since task definitions define how containers will run, a plethora of information can be found within.
**Pacu** tool can enumerate ECS (list-clusters, list-container-instances, list-services, list-task-definitions), it can also dump task definitions.
